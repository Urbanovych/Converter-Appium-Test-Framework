Hi, reviewer!

This is my capstone project for course "QA engineer to Mobile QA engineer".
For my work I choose android app "FreeUnitConverter".

Project using:
- io.appium
- org.junit.jupiter
- com.google.android

Testing app is pretty old, so I recommended use exact same device emulator (and maybe frameworks versions).
For testing I use:
- Pixel 2 XL with Android Lollipop (5.1 x86)
- Node v18.17.1
- Java Corretto 18.0.2 (you can download it directly in IDEA if it is needed)
- Appium 2.0.1

If you have all of there things - just run free.unit.converter directory in "test" directory.

If you have any problem text me on:
